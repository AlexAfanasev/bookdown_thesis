# Introduction {#intro}

Discounted cash flow models are widely used in the financial industry for determining the present value of an investment. @campbell_shiller_paper present a log linear approximation of the present-value formulation. They show that the current log price-to-dividend ratio (PD) is approximately the sum of a constant plus the difference of discounted, expected future log returns and future log dividend growth. Furthermore, within their setup, both the constant and the discount rate depend on the long-term mean of the PD.

A major assumption for this setup is the existence of the long term mean requiring stationarity of the PD. This requirement has been tested and evaluated by @dog_bark_paper and @h2_paper. Contrary to the assumption made by @campbell_shiller_paper, the results indicate that the PD is indeed nonstationary. Therefore, a more realistic assumption is the nonexistence of the long-term mean. Hence, the discount rate and constant should be regarded as time-varying. 

Based on these findings there have been multiple suggestions for modeling the PD as a nonstationary process. Partially observed Markov processes, also called state-space models, can be used for handling the time-varying long-term mean. To be more precise, it can be handled as a latent process that is directly connected to the observation process of the PD. 

As an example, the latent mean can be modeled with discrete shifts as proposed by @van_nieuwerburgh_paper. However, this project will be mostly based on the results from @h2_paper where a nonlinear state-space model has been applied.

Nonlinear partially observed Markov processes have been successfully used for a variety of statistical modeling tasks for time series data. Besides the already mentioned application for the PD [@h2_paper], further exemplary applications are stochastic volatility models [@stochastic_vol_models], infectious disease models [@covid_paper] or ecological research for predator-prey analysis [@predator_prey_analysis]. Typically, fitting them is computationally very expensive. Hence, fast and robust statistical software is required.

Because of the nonlinear structure of these models, complex Monte Carlo based methods have to be used for obtaining a stochastic estimate of the likelihood function. Trying to use deterministic optimization routines has drawbacks due to inability of handling the stochasticity of the objective function. Luckily, during the last years further advances in estimation procedures for nonlinear state-space models have been made. As a possible solution, Bayesian approaches have been proposed. Of great interest will be the recently developed particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, in particular the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings procedure (PMMH) [@doucet_pmmh].

This master's thesis will extend the work presented by @h2_paper by applying Bayesian techniques to the problem of estimating the latent mean of the PD. All in all, this project will have the following goals:

1) Using a nonlinear model setup, compare the estimation results using a deterministic optimization routine with the results from the Bayesian PMMH procedure.

2) Based on the model setup used by @h2_paper, apply the Bayesian approach. Estimate and compare different state processes with and without exogenous covariates.

Chapter two will start with a review of the existing literature. Already applied state-space models will be presented in the context of the log linear approximation of the present-value formulation. Moreover, conducted research around macroeconomic variables affecting the latent mean of the PD, new inferential procedures surrounding nonlinear state-space models and corresponding software will be inspected. The third chapter will present the basic structure of partially observed Markov processes. There, likelihood based and Bayesian approaches will be explained. In chapter four a simulation study, that is closely related to the empirical application, will be conducted. The likelihood based approach will be compared with the PMMH approach using different prior specifications. Chapter five will present the results of the empirical application. The latent mean of the PD will be filtered and the state and observation process parameters estimated. Besides that, the effect of further macroeconomic variables will be tested, and a state process containing these exogenous covariates evaluated. Finally, the last chapter will be the conclusion.
