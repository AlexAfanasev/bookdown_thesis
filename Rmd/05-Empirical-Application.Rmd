# Empirical Application {#application}

<!-- ## Models and Data {#models_data} -->

<!-- **Content:** -->

<!-- - Add short description of the model and the data (content from previous paper) and the chosen prior distributions -->

<!-- ## Results{#application_results} -->

<!-- **Content:** -->

<!-- - Analyising the filtered latent process of mean log price dividend ratio by incorporating covariates in the state equation of the latent process -->

<!--     - possible covariates (USA GDP, Earnings S&P 500,  consumption risk, ratio of middle aged to young people in USA, effective federal fund rate) -->

<!--     - test for cointegration of these variables with latent process estimated by simple random walk model         -->

<!-- - Add these covariates to latent process and estimate the parameters using MCMC and the particle filter together (PMMH) -->

<!--     - use informative priors and compare the results -->

<!--     - present results from MCMC procedure and apply the predictive regressions -->
