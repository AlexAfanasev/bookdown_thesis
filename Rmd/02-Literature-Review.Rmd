# Literature review {#literature-review}

A variety of state space-models have been applied in the context of the log linear approximation of the present-value formulation. In particular, assuming stationarity of the PD and hence the existence of the long term mean, Binsbergen and Koijen [@binsbergen_paper] used a linear state-space model for modeling state processes for the expected return and expected dividend growth. Furthermore, in [@tvp_kf] the possibility of time varying parameters has been added to this application.

However, as mentioned, this thesis will focus on the results from [@h2_paper] where the PD has been modeled as a nonstationary process. There the latent mean has been characterized as a random walk and as a autoregressive process of order one. The results indicate that the random walk model is superior measured by typical model comparison figures as the Bayesian information criterion. 

Furthermore, parameter inference has been carried out by maximizing the likelihood using the Nelderâ€“Mead optimization method, see [@nelder_mead]. Using this approach, due to the stochasticity of the likelihood function, the hessian cannot be approximated reliably and therefore confidence intervals for the parameters based on the observed Fisher information cannot be retrieved. 

In [@h2_paper2] a similar nonlinear state-space model has been applied, however for the price-to-rent ratio of the US housing market using the Federal Housing Finance Agency housing price index. Parameter inference has been conducted using multiple runs of a grid search procedure. Again, uncertainty quantification of parameter estimates is not feasible within this setup.

This master's thesis will therefore try to extend the summarized approaches by applying the Bayesian PMMH approach. Hence, after having obtained an approximation of the posterior distribution it is possible to retrieve credible intervals for the parameters of interest and pointwise credible intervals for the filtered state process.

Besides that, using the filtered latent mean possible determinants have been studied within a cointegration analysis in [@h2_paper]. This analysis has shown that a cointegration relationship between the latent mean of the PD, consumption risk, the middle-aged to young ratio and the proportion of firms with traditional dividend payout policy exists. Hence, adding to these results further macroeconomic variables will be inspected via a cointegration analysis and by estimating further state process extensions containing exogenous covariates directly.

In particular, the effect of monetary policy affecting the latent mean of the PD will be inspected. Empirical evidence [@monetary_policy_1; @monetary_policy_2; @monetary_policy_asset_prices] has shown that monetary policy, especially quantitative easing, affects asset prices. Therefore, the effects of changes in real M1 money supply growth and the effective federal funds rate will be investigated. Moreover, the possible link between economic growth and increasing stock prices will be checked as well, even though research indicates that this relationship is questionable [@economic_growth].

As mentioned, nonlinear state-space models require fast software implementations due to complex Monte Carlo procedures being employed. For the \texttt{R} programming language three possible and freely available packages are available for modeling nonlinear state-space models: \texttt{Biips} [@biips_paper], \texttt{NIMBLE} [@nimble_paper], \texttt{pomp} [@pomp_article]. The first two are extensions of the BUGS software for Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), see [@bugs_paper]. 

For this masters thesis the \texttt{pomp} package has been used. Contrary to the other two it contains simulation based algorithms for both Bayesian and likelihood based procedures. Furthermore, its plug and play architecture makes it easy to develop and test new models. Moreover, for speeding up the inferential procedures it allows to program lower level code in \texttt{C}. Besides that, within this project all applications have been run on a powerful cloud server, parallel computing has been used and some key code parts have been written in \texttt{C++} using \texttt{Rcpp} [@rcpp] and \texttt{RcppArmadillo} [@rcpparmadillo].
