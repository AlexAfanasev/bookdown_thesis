# Literature review {#literature-review}

speak about why pomp models so interesting (economic, disease modelling etc.) with links

speak about why mcmc extension so interessting and where it has been applied

speak about extensions that have been used (modelling expected return/dividend growth instead of latent lpd)

1. pomp package for modelling
- various methods for pomp models
- mostly used for infectious disease modelling (rarely in economics) --> hence applied in this context new

2. complex simulations & computational intensive procedures:
- parallel programming
- C from pomp and Rcpp/RcppArmadillo necessary for speed
