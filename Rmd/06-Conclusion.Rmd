The basic structure of partially observed Markov processes and corresponding numerical procedures for inference have been described briefly. Furthermore, a simulation study has been conducted and the results of likelihood based and Bayesian approaches for parameter and latent state estimation have been presented. There, different prior setups have been tested and a general superiority of either the likelihood or the Bayesian approach could not be identified. However, the advantage of the Bayesian approach for providing uncertainty quantification for parameter and latent state estimates has been used for the empirical application. 

Based on the log linear approximation of the present-value formulation presented in [@campbell_shiller_paper], a nonlinear state-space model has been derived as in [@h2_paper]. Firstly, a random walk state process has been used for the latent mean of the PD. The PMMH approach has been successfully applied for estimating the parameter and latent state and for providing the corresponding uncertainty quantification.

Similar to the steps applied in [@h2_paper], a cointegration analysis has been conducted by including macroeconomic variables characterizing monetary policy effects and economic growth. However, a cointegration relationship could not be detected. An additional model containing some of the covariates has been tested. The random walk state setup and the state model containing covariates follow similar paths. However, the model comparison results showed that the model with a random walk state process is superior.

All in all, the particle marginal Metropolis Hastings approach has been successfully applied to the context of a nonlinear state-space model for the log linear approximation of the present-value formulation.

As a possible outlook, further advances in MCMC approaches for nonlinear partially observed Markov processes are available. Especially, being able to generate proposals that are more likely to be accepted, by adding gradient estimates to the MCMC approaches, seems to be promising. Additionally, another interesting application would be the likelihood based iterated filtering procedure and the corresponding confidence interval estimation using the Monte Carlo adjusted
profile algorithm.
